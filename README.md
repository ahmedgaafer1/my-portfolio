## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a front-end developer with a civil engineering background. After gaining hands-on experience in the engineering field, I transitioned into tech through the Front-End Angular program at Route Academy and the Cross-Platform Development track at ITI.

I focus on building elegant, efficient UIs and delivering smooth digital experiences across platforms. I’m currently working on real-world projects to sharpen my skills and explore new technologies. I'm open to internship or junior roles where I can grow and contribute to impactful solutions.
